## Description

This project aims at providing a complete plan for the expansion of an enterprise.
We adopt a ficticious use case of XPTO Lda, an engineering services company in the area of IoT (Internet of Things) in Aveiro, that wishes to expand its offices and create a new branch in Porto (two cities in Portugal).

Our job as network engineers was to analyse the current state of the company’s infrastructures’ architecture, plan the integration of the new building in Aveiro and assure the quality and security of the whole network, including the connection between branches.
The result is documented and a presentation is provided.

Below we provide a logical diagram of the network, simulated in GNS3.
